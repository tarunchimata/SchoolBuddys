?? Next Suggested Steps
1. Build a Database Schema for users, schools, admins, messages, roles.
2. Design Wireframes for key screens (school profile, registration, messaging, admin panel).
3. Create a Technical Requirements Document for MVP development.
4. Kick off MVP in phases:
   - Phase 1: Core platform with user verification, school spaces, messaging
   - Phase 2: Mobile app + gallery + memory wall
   - Phase 3: Career, mentorship, and video integration
